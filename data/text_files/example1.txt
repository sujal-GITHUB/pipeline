        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
        Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes clear syntax and code readability, making it an ideal choice for beginners as well as professionals. 
        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming, and has an extensive standard library that simplifies many common programming tasks.

        Today, Python is widely used across diverse fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing. 
        Its large community and ecosystem of powerful frameworks — like Django, Flask, NumPy, and TensorFlow — make it one of the most popular and influential languages in modern software development.
